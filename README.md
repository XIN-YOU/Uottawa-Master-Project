World-wide, there is approximately one case of oral cleft disease for every seven hundred births, making it a fairly common birth defect. Researchers are, therefore interested in discovering how genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to this disease risk. Birth defects may be linked to the mother’s genetic variants in conjunction with environmental factors. These factors may contribute to the risk of disease while the baby is in utero. Luckily, pathway-based association analyses have become popular approaches for discovering how genetic variants contribute to diseases, such as cleft palate.


In this project, we develop an approach to simulate data on trios where the probability of disease is increased by maternal genetic effects and maternal gene-environment effects on genes in selected pathways. Development of the simulation algorithm was motivated by a need to compare the performance of pathway-based statistical approaches in detecting maternal gene-environment effects on a cleft palate data set collected from trios. We illustrate the use of the simulation algorithm by investigating the type 1 error rate when there are no true genetic effects and by examining mating type asymmetry when there are true maternal gene-environment effects. Our algorithm will be of use for investigating the power and type 1 error
